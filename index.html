			<h1> Nathan Forester </h1>
			<h2> Brown Toast, Bike Rides and DevOps</h2>
			<p class='text-center'> Nathan is reluctantly talented yet willingly capable of most things. Apart from scaling very tall buildings. And flying. Apart from that, he can just about put ham-fisted finger to keyboard to PRACTICE and search stack overflow to solve just about any technical problem he creates where there is none. </p>

						<h3>Travel</h3>
						<p class='text-left'> This picture was taken in the French Concession of Shanghai and, this store, called Nathan Road (just like Nathan), mimics the popular Hong Kong street of Nathan Road, where Nathan lived for a year also. It was at this point that Nathan found his passion for differentiating between variables in programming languages!.</p>
